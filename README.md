# 06-3D-RPG
Basic RPG with target practice

Includes NPC with dialogue that starts the timer and the targets
# Assets
Assets were gathered from Kenny.nl and the terrain was from Jaynam's Patreon Page

#Further Development
I would like to fix the problem of the dialogue being skipped and to add in an obstacle that makes it harder to shoot the targets, or add in mechanics that make it that there is a certain order in which the targets need to be shot.
